<h1>RSS Feed available!</h1>
<p>
An RSS feed is now available at <a href="https://nwalsh1995.github.io/rss.xml">https://nwalsh1995.github.io/rss.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
The RSS feed is generated by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwalsh1995/nwalsh1995.github.io/master/generate_rss.py">this script</a>. It uses a RSS library that I built since I was interested in learning how RSS works. The library is very simple and /should/ support RSS 2.0. The library is available <a href="https://github.com/nwalsh1995/min-rss-gen">here.</a>
