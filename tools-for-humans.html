<h1>tools for humans</h1>
<p>
My idea of the perfect tool is one that I can use to get the job done as efficiently and pleasantly as possible. That is to say it is something that can be used to fulfill a specific task. For instance, would you keep using and carrying around a shovel after you have finished digging a hole? Why would you ever return to use a shovel? Presumably because you have another hole to dig and thus a need.

Digital services have a huge advantage over physical items. Consider a physical book, if the author could watch their readers (while they are reading the book) then the author could determine where readers decided not to finish. This data allows for the author to iterate, change the troublesome section with something more appealing gain readership. If more people finish the book they are more likely to recommend it, increasing popularity and ultimately lead to more readers. This leads us to a distinction: physical items require third party observation for usage information, digital services do not.

In relation to a shovel, the most popular websites are optimized for attention and increasing the users time of 'eyes on screen'. Some tech business models spring to mind which rely on captivating the user: advertisments (the dominant business model of Google, Facebook, Twitter), microtransacations (the dominant business model of 'free-to-play' games like Fortnite), content consumption (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, many other streaming services). Digital services collect data automatically; without an observer. With the data in hand, experiments are created, tested, and measured against key metrics (like active time on screen or session length). Digital services evolve quicker and back propagate against their optimization function.

Then, consider the question: does time spent using a tool imply its value? Trivially, the answer is no. Shovel A takes me 30 minutes to finish digging a hole while shovel B takes me an hour. I prefer shovel A to lessen the amount of work required. So, if time spent using a tool does not imply value then how can we determine the amount of value digital services provide? I leave this post as an open question as I find the answer to be subjective. Do your tools work for you?
