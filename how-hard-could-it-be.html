<h1>How hard could it be?</h1>
<p>
When facing unknowns in programming it is very easy to rely on abstractions built for you by others. When time-constrained it might be more valuable for you to pick up where a framework leaves you, rather than implementing it yourself. Additionally, if you already went through the work of validating the abstraction for correctness and understand its inner workings and design decisions along with its tradeoffs then I can only trust your judgement.

What about those times where you weren't time pressured? What about those times where you reviewed the existing libraries and found them unsuitable for your needs? When faced with an unknown and non-trivial problem, how will you approach it? The answer to these questions displays your will to learn.

What I have found most successful for myself is the simple thought 'how hard could it be?'. For instance, I became interested in JWTs and the pieces it is founded on (JWS, JWE). I thought, "If I had to implement this technology how hard could it be?". Really, I had seen everyone using JWTs, heard people give talks on JWTs, and have even used JWTs (minimally) before. How hard could it actually be? Arguably the hardest problem was with the creation of the JWT as an idea which must work across organizations, allow for customization, maintain flexibility for future changes, provide clear guidance on security, and most importantly provide documentation on how to use it properly. For me, the implementor, the biggest challenge is comprehending the words in the RFC and following the specifications. Really... how hard could it be?
