<h1>15 minutes per day</h1>
<p>
Recently I have been feeling unsatified with the amount of progress I was making on side-projects. Every night I would think about the time I spent not working on them and how I was wasting time in other places. However, the next day I was sticking to the same schedule, and again regretting my decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to put more time into side-projects I implemented a "15 minutes per day" 'rule'. No matter what happened in the day, I was going to put 15 minutes of focused time into the project. 15 minutes is the minimum amount, an amount of time that I felt would allow me to progress on the project. Focused time is also important; time that is spent distraction-free.
<br/>
<br/>
Since implementing and following such a rule, I constantly find myself sinking much more than the minimum 15 minutes. I believe this is due to the fact that for some problems, 15 minutes is simply not enough. Instead of stopping development on these problems, I continued them out to their 'prototype' stage which would normally take around an hour.
<br/>
<br/>
From my results of obeying such a rule, it seems that the biggest problem I had was resuming work on the project. In my head there were a lot of moving pieces that were very complex, and the simplest approach was to avoid them. However, once beginning the project I was able to focus on getting the most out of the 15 minutes that were to be spent, which allowed me to think differently about the problems I was facing, and just try to get something working. Often, I would come to a solution that I found acceptable, and I was able to obtain the sense of progression that I was looking for.
